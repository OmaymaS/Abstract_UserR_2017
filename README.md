# UseR 2017 Abstract

## Once Upon Data: The Tidyverse as A Tool to Understand Our Users and Tell Their Stories

While designing products for humans and taking data-driven decisions, we usually face the challenge of capturing the relevant signal and determining where to dig deeper, in order to better understand our customers, address their needs and keep them engaged. With the big amount of data generated daily, we need simple tools to switch between the big picture and the details efficiently without falling into the trap of oversimplification nor getting lost into details. 

The **Tidyverse** provides a framework that helps us see each segment clearly, no matter how small it is. Its packages that work in harmony enable us to zoom in and out, consider individuals as well as groups, imagine their journey while using our products and tell their stories. With this understanding, we can identify hidden issues in our products, introduce new features, discover unaddressed needs, improve user experience and iterate quickly. 

This talk will focus on how I benefit from the Tidyverse while dealing with our data, starting from data wrangling and transformation, to modeling and visualization in order to communicate results effectively, which drives better business decisions.
